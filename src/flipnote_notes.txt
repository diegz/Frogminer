My scratch notes for porting ugopwn (Lenny version) to FN JPN v0.
It was a lot messier than this at one point.

-Region[Version]
-Payload RAM offset (minitwlpayload)
-Flipnote RAM offset (PARA)
-Hax code positioning offset relative to PARA (?)

Additional notes:

* The loaded flipnote positon in memory and the positioning variable always has the same distance apart, 227AE3F.
02829A20-5AEBE1=227AE3F
028AAE40-630001=227AE3F
02843920-5C8AE1=227AE3F
028195C0-59E781=227AE3F
026E56E0-46A8A1=227AE3F

* v0 doesn't let you copy frames between different flipnote files so I had to work around this by appending the
payload/hax frame (800031_...) to the target frame file (T00031_...). As a nice side effect, this makes the exploit triggering process easier.

* Couldn't get useful RAM dumps from no$gba for JPN flipnote versions  due to title screen crashes, but it's possible to dump dsiram by rebooting the 3ds and immediately chainloading godmode9, then dumping fcram.mem.
I use the included fcram2dsiram script to decode the weird "spread out" chunked format of dsi ram in fcram. the first half meg or so is overwritten by the 3ds but that's not an issue in most cases.
